/**
 * Switches the bottom navigation bar to [tab] while preserving the state of
 * every top-level destination, including the NomadNet browser.
 *
 * The NomadNet browser keeps its live site session (the entry-scoped
 * [network.libertychat.app.viewmodel.NomadNetBrowserViewModel] and its in-memory
 * page) when the user moves to another tab and comes back: the entry is saved
 * and restored rather than popped, so the page the user left is still on
 * screen with no re-fetch.
 *
 * Re-tapping the NomadNet tab while already browsing is a no-op; the site
 * session ends via Close Site or Back, not by re-tapping the tab.
